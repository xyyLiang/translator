{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_generics_interface_generic_interface_definition': 'In Cangjie code language, Generics can be used to define generic interfaces, such as the Iterable defined in the standard library, whose member function Iterator needs to return an Iterator type, which is a container traverser. Iterator is a generic interface, inside Iterator there is a next member function that returns the next element from the container type, and the type returned by the next member function is a type that needs to be specified when using it, so Iterator needs to declare generic parameters.'\n\nCode_Example:\npublic interface Iterable<E> {\n    func iterator(): Iterator<E>\n}\n\npublic interface Iterator<E> <: Iterable<E> {\n    func next(): Option<E>\n}\n\npublic interface Collection<T> <: Iterable<T> {\n     prop size: Int64\n     func isEmpty(): Bool\n}"}
