{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_generics_overview_generic_overview': 'In Cangjie code language, Generics in Cangjie refer to parameterized types, which are types that are declared with type parameters. These type parameters are specified when the generic type or function is used. The most common examples are container types like Array<T> and Set<T>.\nIn Cangjie, functions, classes, interfaces, structs, and enums can all be generic by declaring type parameters.\nTo facilitate discussion, the following terms are commonly used:\nType parameter: A type or function declaration may have one or more types that need to be specified when used. These types are called type parameters. When declaring type parameters, an identifier must be provided to reference them within the declaration body.\nType variable: When type parameters are declared, the identifiers used to reference these types are called type variables.\nType argument: When using a generic type or function, the specified parameters are called type arguments.\nType constructor: A type that requires zero, one, or more types as arguments is called a type constructor.\nType parameters are generally declared after the type or function name, enclosed in angle brackets <...>. For example, a generic list can be declared as follows:\n\nclass List<T> {\n    var head: Option<T>\n    var tail: Option<List<T>>\n}\n\nIn this example:\nList<T>: T is the type parameter.\nelem: Option<T>: T is the type variable.\ntail: Option<List<T>>: T is the type variable.\nList<Int64>: Int64 is the type argument for List.\nList is the type constructor, and List<Int64> constructs a list type with Int64 as the type argument.'\n\nCode_Example:\nclass List<T> {\n    var elem: Option<T> = None\n    var tail: Option<List<T>> = None\n}\nfunc sumInt(a: List<Int64>) {  }"}
