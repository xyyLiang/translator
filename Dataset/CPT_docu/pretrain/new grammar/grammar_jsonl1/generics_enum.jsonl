{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_generics_enum_generic_enum_definition': 'In Cangjie code language, In the design of generic enum types in the Cangjie programming language, the Option type is a typical example, and for a detailed description of Option, please refer to the Option type chapter. The Option type is used to indicate that a value of a type may be empty. In this way, Option can be used to represent a failure to compute on a certain type. It's uncertain what type of failure is here, so it's clear that Option is a generic type that needs to be declared as a type parameter.\nAs you can see, Option<T> is divided into two cases, one is Some(T), which is used to represent a return result with value, and the other is None which is used to represent an empty result. The getOrThrow function will be a function that returns the value inside Some(T), and the result returned is the T type, and if the parameter is None, then it will throw an exception directly.'\n\nCode_Example:\npackage std.core // `Option` is defined in std.core.\n\npublic enum Option<T> {\n      Some(T)\n    | None\n\n    public func getOrThrow(): T {\n        match (this) {\n            case Some(v) => v\n            case None => throw NoneValueException()\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}"}
