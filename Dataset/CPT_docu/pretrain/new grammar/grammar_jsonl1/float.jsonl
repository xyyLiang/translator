{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_float_float_types': 'In Cangjie code language, Cangjie supports three floating-point types: Float16, Float32, and Float64. These types represent floating-point numbers with 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit encoding lengths, respectively. They correspond to the half-precision (binary16), single-precision (binary32), and double-precision (binary64) formats in IEEE 754.\nFloat16: Approximately 3 decimal digits of precision.\nFloat32: Approximately 6 decimal digits of precision.\nFloat64: Approximately 15 decimal digits of precision.\nWhen choosing a floating-point type, consider the precision and range required by your application. Float64 is generally preferred when multiple options are suitable due to its higher precision and reduced cumulative error.'\n\nCode_Example:\nlet pi: Float64 = 3.141592653589793\nlet smallNumber: Float32 = 0.0001f32\nlet tinyNumber: Float16 = 1.2345e-10f16"}
