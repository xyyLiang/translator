{"text": "QUESTION:In the API section of Cangjie programming language,What is the serialization module in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The serialization module provides serialization and deserialization capabilities.\nCurrently, direct import of the serialization module using import serialization is not supported. Instead, you should import subpackages of serialization.import std.collection.*"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In the API section of Cangjie programming language,What is the serialization package in the serialization module?\nANSWER:The serialization package provides functionalities for serializing and deserializing data. It allows conversion between data structures and byte streams or strings.\nSerialization refers to the process of converting the state of a data structure or object into a usable format (such as saving to a file, storing in a buffer, or sending over a network), so that it can be restored to its original state in a subsequent environment on the same or another computer. Conversely, the reverse operation of extracting data structures from a series of bytes is called deserialization.\nUser-defined types can support serialization and deserialization by implementing the Serializable interface.\n\nFunction Name\tFunction\nfield<T>(String, T)\tUsed to encapsulate a set of data name and data into a Field object.import std.collection.*\nimport serialization.serialization.*\nimport encoding.json.*\nmain(): Unit {\n    let s: HashSet<Values> = HashSet<Values>([Values(3), Values(5), Values(7)])\n    let seris: DataModel = s.serialize()\n    println(seris.toJson().toJsonString())\n    println(\""}
