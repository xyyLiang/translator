{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the String type in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The String type in Cangjie represents a sequence of Unicode characters used to store text data. Strings are immutable and can be defined using various literal forms.let greeting: String = \"Hello, World!\"\nlet greeting2 = 'Hello Cangjie Lang'"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are string literals represented in Cangjie?\nANSWER:String literals in Cangjie can be represented in three forms:\nSingle-line string literals: Defined within a pair of single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). They cannot span multiple lines.\nMulti-line string literals: Defined using triple double quotes (\"\"\") or triple single quotes ('''). They can span multiple lines.\nRaw multi-line string literals: Defined using one or more hash symbols (#) followed by a single quote (') or double quote (\"). They can span multiple lines and do not interpret escape sequences.let s1: String = \"\"\nlet s2 = 'Hello Cangjie Lang'\nlet s3 = \"\\\"Hello Cangjie Lang\\\"\"\nlet s4 = 'Hello Cangjie Lang\\n'\n\nlet s1: String = \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\nlet s2 = '''\n    Hello,\n    Cangjie Lang'''\n\nlet s1: String = #\"\"#\nlet s2 = ##'\\n'##\nlet s3 = ###\"\n    Hello,\n    Cangjie\n    Lang\"###"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How does string interpolation work in Cangjie?\nANSWER:String interpolation in Cangjie allows embedding expressions within string literals, which are evaluated and inserted into the string. Interpolation is not supported in raw multi-line string literals. Interpolation expressions are enclosed in curly braces {} and prefixed with $.The curly braces can contain one or more declarations or expressions.When evaluating interpolated strings, each interpolated expression's position is replaced by the value of the last item in {}, and the entire interpolated string remains a string.main() {\n    let fruit = \"apples\"\n    let count = 10\n    let s = \"There are ${count * count} ${fruit}\"\n    println(s)\n\n\n    let r = 2.4\n    let area = \"The area of a circle with radius ${r} is ${let PI = 3.141592; PI * r * r}\"\n    println(area)\n}\n//output：There are 100 apples/n The area of a circle with radius 2.400000 is 18.095570"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What operations are supported by the String type in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The String type in Cangjie supports the following operations:\nRelational operators: Equality (==) and inequality (!=) comparisons.\nConcatenation: Using the + operator to concatenate strings.\nOther common operations: Methods like split, replace, and more.main() {\n    let s1 = \"abc\"\n    var s2 = \"ABC\"\n    let r1 = s1 == s2\n    println(\"The result of 'abc' == 'ABC' is: ${r1}\")\n    let r2 = s1 + s2\n    println(\"The result of 'abc' + 'ABC' is: ${r2}\")\n}\n//output:\n//The result of 'abc' == 'ABC' is: false\n//The result of 'abc' + 'ABC' is: abcABC"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How is the assignment operation of strings carried out in Cangjie?\nANSWER:For assignment operations of the form left = right, if the type of the left operand is Byte (an alias of the built-in type UInt8), and the right operand is a string literal representing an ASCII character, then the string on the right operand will be forcibly converted to the Byte type before assignment; if the type of the left operand is Rune, and the right operand is a single-character string literal, then the string on the right operand will be forcibly converted to the Rune type before assignment.main() {\n    var b: Byte = \"0\"\n    print(b)\n    b = \"1\"\n    print(b)\n    var r: Rune = \"0\"\n    print(r)\n    r = \"1\"\n    print(r)\n}\n//output:484901"}
