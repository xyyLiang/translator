{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to use HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Using the HashSet type requires importing a collection package:import std.collection.*\nYou can use the HashSet type to construct a Collection with only distinct elements.Cangjie uses HashSet<T> to represent the HashSet type, T to represent the element type of the HashSet, and T must be a type that implements the Hashable and Equatable<T> interfaces, such as Numeric or String.import std.collection.*\nvar a: HashSet<Int64> = ... // HashSet whose element type is Int64\nvar b: HashSet<String> = ... // HashSet whose element type is String"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are the properties of HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:HashSet ensures that all elements are unique.\nHashSet instances with different element types are considered different types and cannot be assigned to each other.\n\nError_case:\nvar a: HashSet<Int64> = ...\nvar b: HashSet<String> = ...\nb = a // This will cause a compile-time error"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to construct a HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:In Cangjie, you can use a constructor to construct a specified HashSet.let a = HashSet<String>() // Created an empty HashSet whose element type is String\nlet b = HashSet<String>(100) // Created a HashSet whose capacity is 100\nlet c = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2]) // Created a HashSet whose element type is Int64, containing elements 0, 1, 2\nlet d = HashSet<Int64>(c) // Use another Collection to initialize a HashSet\nlet e = HashSet<Int64>(10, {x: Int64 => (x * x)}) // Created a HashSet whose element type is Int64 and size is 10. All elements are initialized by specified rule function"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to traverse elements in a HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:You can use a for-in loop to iterate through all elements in a HashSet. Note that HashSet does not guarantee the order of elements, so the traversal order may differ from the insertion order.import std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let mySet = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\n    for (i in mySet) {\n        println(\"The element is ${i}\")\n    }\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to get the size of a HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:You can use the size property to get the number of elements in a HashSet.import std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let mySet = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\n    if (mySet.size == 0) {\n        println(\"This is an empty hashset\")\n    } else {\n        println(\"The size of hashset is ${mySet.size}\")\n    }\n}\n//output:The size of hashset is 3"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to check if an element exists in a HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:You can use the contains function to check if an element exists in a HashSet. It returns true if the element is present, otherwise false.let mySet = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\nlet a = mySet.contains(0) // a == true\nlet b = mySet.contains(-1) // b == false"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to modify a HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:A HashSet is a mutable reference type that provides the ability to add elements and remove them.\nThe mutability of a HashSet is a very useful feature that allows all references to the same HashSet instance to share the same element and modify them uniformly.\nUse the put function to add a single element to the HashSet.\nUse the putAll function to add multiple elements from another collection (e.g., Array).\nUse the remove function to delete an element from the HashSet.let mySet = HashSet<Int64>()\nmySet.put(0) // mySet contains elements 0\nmySet.put(0) // mySet contains elements 0\nmySet.put(1) // mySet contains elements 0, 1\nlet li = [2, 3]\nmySet.putAll(li) // mySet contains elements 0, 1, 2, 3"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How do reference semantics work for HashSet in Cangjie?\nANSWER:HashSet is a reference type, meaning that all references to the same HashSet instance share the same data. Modifications to the elements of a HashSet affect all references to that instance.let set1 = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\nlet set2 = set1\nset2.put(3)\n// set1 contains elements 0, 1, 2, 3\n// set2 contains elements 0, 1, 2, 3"}
