{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are extensions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Extensions in Cangjie allow you to add new functionality to types that are visible in the current package, except for functions, tuples, and interfaces. Extensions can add member functions, operator overloading functions, member properties, and implement interfaces.\nExtensions can be used when you want to add additional functionality to a type without breaking its encapsulation."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What capabilities can be added by extensions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Extensions can add the following capabilities to a type:\nMember functions: Add new functions to the type.\nOperator overloading functions: Add new operator overloads to the type.\nMember properties: Add new properties to the type.\nInterface implementation: Implement interfaces for the type."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are the restrictions on extensions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Extensions in Cangjie have the following restrictions:\nNo member variables: Extensions cannot add member variables to the type.\nMust have implementations: Functions and properties added by extensions must have implementations.\nNo open, override, or redef: Functions and properties added by extensions cannot use the open, override, or redef modifiers.\nNo access to private members: Extensions cannot access members of the extended type that are marked as private."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What types of extensions are available in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Extensions in Cangjie can be categorized into two types:\nDirect extensions: Extensions that do not implement additional interfaces.\nInterface extensions: Extensions that implement additional interfaces. Interface extensions can be used to add new functionality and implement interfaces, enhancing abstraction flexibility."}
