{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are nested functions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:In Cangjie, functions defined within another function are called nested functions. Nested functions have access to the variables and parameters of their enclosing function and can be used to encapsulate logic that is only relevant within the scope of the outer function.func foo() {\n    func nestAdd(a: Int64, b: Int64) {\n        a + b + 3\n    }\n    println(nestAdd(1, 2))  // 6\n    return nestAdd\n}\nmain() {\n    let f = foo()\n    let x = f(1, 2)\n    println(\"result: ${x}\")\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the scope of nested functions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Nested functions in Cangjie are scoped to their enclosing function. They can access variables and parameters defined in the outer function but are not accessible outside the outer function's scope. However, nested functions can be returned from the outer function and used outside the scope where they were defined."}
