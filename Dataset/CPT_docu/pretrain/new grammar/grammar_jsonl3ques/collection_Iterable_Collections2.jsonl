{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to use Iterable in Cangjie?\nANSWER:In Cangjie, types like Range, Array, and ArrayList support the for-in syntax for iteration. This is achieved through the Iterable interface. Any type that implements the Iterable interface can be iterated using the for-in syntax."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How is for-in equivalent to a while-loop in Cangjie?\nANSWER:A for-in loop in Cangjie can be translated into a while loop using the iterator and next methods. For example, the following for-in loop:\nlet list = [1, 2, 3]\nfor (i in list) {\n    println(i)\n}\n}\nis equivalent to the following while loop:\n\nlet list = [1, 2, 3]\nvar it = list.iterator()\nwhile (true) {\n    match (it.next()) {\n        case Some(i) => println(i)\n        case None => break\n    }\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the Iterable interface in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The Iterable interface is an internal interface in Cangjie that supports iteration. It has the following core structure:\ninterface Iterable<T> {\n    func iterator(): Iterator<T>\n    ...\n}\nThe iterator function returns an Iterator object, which is another internal interface.interface Iterator<T> <: Iterable<T> {\n    mut func next(): Option<T>\n    ...\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to use while-let with Iterable in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Another way to iterate over an Iterable is using the while-let syntax, which is a more concise form of the while loop. For example:\nlet list = [1, 2, 3]\nvar it = list.iterator()\nwhile (let Some(i) <- it.next()) {\n    println(i)\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,Which collections implement Iterable in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The following collection types in Cangjie implement the Iterable interface and can be used with for-in or while-let:Array、ArrayList、HashSet、HashMap"}
