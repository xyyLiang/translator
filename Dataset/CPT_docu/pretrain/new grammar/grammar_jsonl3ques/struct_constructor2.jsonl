{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are struct instances created in Cangjie?\nANSWER:To create an instance of a struct in Cangjie, you call the struct's constructor using the struct type name. This is done outside the struct definition.let r = Rectangle(10, 20)"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are struct members accessed in Cangjie?\nANSWER:After creating a struct instance, you can access its instance member variables and member functions through the instance, provided they meet the visibility requirements (e.g., public).let r = Rectangle(10, 20)\nlet width = r.width   // width = 10\nlet height = r.height // height = 20\nlet a = r.area()      // a = 200"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are struct members modified in Cangjie?\nANSWER:To modify the value of a member variable through a struct instance, the struct variable must be defined as mutable (var), and the member variable itself must also be mutable (var).struct Rectangle {\n    public var width: Int64\n    public var height: Int64\n    public init(width: Int64, height: Int64) {\n        this.width = width\n        this.height = height\n    }\n    public func area() {\n        width * height\n    }\n}\nmain() {\n    var r = Rectangle(10, 20) // r.width = 10, r.height = 20\n    r.width = 8               // r.width = 8\n    r.height = 24             // r.height = 24\n    let a = r.area()          // a = 192\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are struct instances copied in Cangjie?\nANSWER:When assigning or passing a struct instance as a parameter, the instance is copied. If the member variables are of reference types, only the references are copied, not the referenced objects. Modifying one instance does not affect the other.struct Rectangle {\n    public var width: Int64\n    public var height: Int64\n    public init(width: Int64, height: Int64) {\n        this.width = width\n        this.height = height\n    }\n    public func area() {\n        width * height\n    }\n}\n\nmain() {\n    var r1 = Rectangle(10, 20) // r1.width = 10, r1.height = 20\n    var r2 = r1                // r2.width = 10, r2.height = 20\n    r1.width = 8               // r1.width = 8\n    r1.height = 24             // r1.height = 24\n    let a1 = r1.area()         // a1 = 192\n    let a2 = r2.area()         // a2 = 200\n}"}
