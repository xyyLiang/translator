{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,Where else can patterns be used in Cangjie?\nANSWER:In Cangjie, patterns are not limited to match expressions; they can also be used in variable definitions and for-in expressions. However, only irrefutable patterns are allowed in these contexts.\nVariable definitions: Patterns can be used on the left-hand side of variable definitions to destructure values.\nFor-in expressions: Patterns can be used between the for and in keywords to destructure elements in a loop.main() {\n    let _ = 100\n    for (_ in 1..5) {\n        println(\"0\")\n    }\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are patterns used in variable definitions in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Patterns can be used in variable definitions to destructure values. Only irrefutable patterns (such as wildcard patterns, binding patterns, irrefutable tuple patterns, and irrefutable enum patterns) are allowed.//wildcard patterns \nmain() {\n    let _ = 100\n    for (_ in 1..5) {\n        println(\"0\")\n    }\n}\n// binding patterns\nmain() {\n    let x = 100\n    println(\"x = ${x}\")\n    for (i in 1..5) {\n        println(i)\n    }\n}\n//irrefutable tuple pattern\nmain() {\n    let (x, y) = (100, 200)\n    println(\"x = ${x}\")\n    println(\"y = ${y}\")\n    for ((i, j) in [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]) {\n        println(\"Sum = ${i + j}\")\n    }\n}\n//irrefutable enum pattern \nenum RedColor {\n    Red(Int64)\n}\nmain() {\n    let Red(red) = Red(0)\n    println(\"red = ${red}\")\n    for (Red(r) in [Red(10), Red(20), Red(30)]) {\n        println(\"r = ${r}\")\n    }\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are irrefutable tuple patterns in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Irrefutable tuple patterns can be used in variable definitions and for-in expressions to destructure tuple values. All sub-patterns within the tuple pattern must also be irrefutable.main() {\n    let (x, y) = (100, 200)\n    println(\"x = ${x}\")\n    println(\"y = ${y}\")\n    for ((i, j) in [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]) {\n        println(\"Sum = ${i + j}\")\n    }\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are irrefutable enum patterns in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Irrefutable enum patterns can be used in variable definitions and for-in expressions to destructure enum values. The enum type must have only one constructor, and all sub-patterns must be irrefutable.enum RedColor {\n    Red(Int64)\n}\nmain() {\n    let Red(red) = Red(0)\n    println(\"red = ${red}\")\n    for (Red(r) in [Red(10), Red(20), Red(30)]) {\n        println(\"r = ${r}\")\n    }\n}"}
