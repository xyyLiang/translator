{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the Nothing type in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The Nothing type in Cangjie is a special type that contains no values. It is a subtype of all other types. Expressions of type Nothing indicate that the execution will not continue normally beyond that point."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How is the Nothing type used in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The Nothing type is used in expressions that terminate the normal flow of execution, such as break, continue, return, and throw. These expressions have the type Nothing because they do not produce a value and indicate that the subsequent code will not be executed.Return can only be used in the function body, and break and continue can only be used in the loop body.while (true) {\n    func f() {\n        break // Error, break must be used directly inside a loop\n    }\n    let g = { =>\n        continue // Error, continue must be used directly inside a loop\n    }\n}\n\nError_case:\nfunc f() {\n    func g(x!: Int64 = return) { // Error, return must be used inside a function body\n        0\n    }\n    1\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are the constraints of the Nothing type in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The Nothing type has the following constraints:\nIt cannot be used explicitly in type annotations.\nIt is only used implicitly in control flow expressions like break, continue, return, and throw."}
