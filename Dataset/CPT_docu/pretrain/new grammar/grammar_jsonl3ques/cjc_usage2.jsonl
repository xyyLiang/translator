{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to use cjc for basic compilation in Cangjie?\nANSWER:cjc is the compilation command for the Cangjie programming language. It provides a rich set of functionalities and corresponding compilation options. By default, cjc compiles the given source code file into an executable named main.\nThe usage of cjc is as follows:cjc [option] file...#If there is a WenYanYi file named hello.cj:\nmain() {\n    println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n# You can use the following command to compile this file:\n$ cjc hello.cj"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the role of cjc-frontend in Cangjie?\nANSWER:cjc-frontend is provided with cjc through the Cangjie SDK. It compiles Cangjie source code to the intermediate representation (LLVM IR). While cjc-frontend shares some compilation options with cjc, the compilation process stops after the frontend compilation. cjc handles both frontend and backend compilation as well as linking. cjc-frontend is primarily for compiler developers; for compiling Cangjie code, cjc should be used.# Using cjc-frontend (for compiler developers)\ncjc-frontend hello.cj"}
