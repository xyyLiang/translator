{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is the Range type in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The Range<T> type in Cangjie represents a sequence of values with a fixed step size. It is a generic type where T must support relational operators and can be added to an Int64 value. The most commonly used instance is Range<Int64>, which represents a sequence of integers.let r1: Range<Int64> = Range<Int64>(0, 10, 1, true, true, true)\nlet r2: Range<Int64> = Range<Int64>(0, 10, 1, true, true, false)\nlet r3: Range<Int64> = Range<Int64>(10, 0, -2, true, true, false)"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are the forms of Range literals in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Range literals in Cangjie come in two forms:\nHalf-open range: start..end : step represents a sequence starting from start, with a step size of step, up to but not including end.\nClosed range: start..=end : step represents a sequence starting from start, with a step size of step, up to and including end.\nIf step is omitted, it defaults to 1. The step value cannot be 0.let n = 10\nlet r1 = 0..10 : 1   // r1 contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nlet r2 = 0..=n : 1   // r2 contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nlet r3 = n..0 : -2   // r3 contains 10, 8, 6, 4, 2\nlet r4 = 10..=0 : -2 // r4 contains 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What properties does a Range instance have in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Each instance of Range<T> has the following properties:\nstart: The starting value of the sequence.\nend: The ending value of the sequence.\nstep: The difference between consecutive elements in the sequence (step size). The type of step is Int64 and its value cannot be 0.let r5 = 0..10   // the step of r5 is 1, and it contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nlet r6 = 0..10 : 0 // Error, step cannot be 0\nlet r7 = 10..0 : 1 // r7 to r10 are empty ranges\nlet r8 = 0..10 : -1\nlet r9 = 10..=0 : 1\nlet r10 = 0..=10 : -1"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,When is a Range considered empty in Cangjie?\nANSWER:A Range is considered empty if it does not contain any elements. This can happen under the following conditions:\nFor start..end : step, the range is empty if step > 0 and start >= end, or if step < 0 and start <= end.\nFor start..=end : step, the range is empty if step > 0 and start > end, or if step < 0 and start < end.let r1 = 0..10 : 0 // Empty range: step cannot be 0\nlet r2 = 10..0 : 1 // Empty range: step > 0 but start > end\nlet r3 = 0..=10 : -1 // Empty range: step < 0 but start < end"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are Ranges iterated in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Ranges in Cangjie can be iterated using a for-in loop. The elements are accessed in the order they appear in the sequence."}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are Ranges used in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Ranges are commonly used in loops, array slicing, and other scenarios where a sequence of values is needed. They provide a convenient way to represent sequences without explicitly creating an array or list."}
