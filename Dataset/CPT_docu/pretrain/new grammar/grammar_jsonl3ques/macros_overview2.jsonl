{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How are macros defined in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Macros in Cangjie are defined within a separate package declared with macro package. They cannot be mixed with other public functions. A macro is declared using the macro keyword, specifying its name, input parameters, and return type. The input and output of a macro are program fragments represented by Tokens.To distinguish a macro call from a function call, use @ followed by the macro's name when calling the macro.//The following example code wants to print the value of an expression during debugging, and also print the expression itself.\nlet x = 3\nlet y = 2\n@dprint(x)        // print \"x = 3\"\n@dprint(x + y)    // print \"x + y = 5\"\n\n//implement a dprint as a macro to get a program fragment of an input expression\nmacro package define\nimport std.ast.*\npublic macro dprint(input: Tokens): Tokens {\n    let inputStr = input.toString()\n    let result = quote(\n        print($(inputStr) + \" = \")\n        println($(input)))\n    return result\n}\n\n//Testing this macro before interpreting each line of code will have the desired effect. First, create a define folder in the current directory and create a dprint.cj file in the define folder, and copy the above content to the dprint.cj file. In addition, create a main.cj in the current directory, which contains the following test code:\nimport define.*\nmain() {\n    let x = 3\n    let y = 2\n    @dprint(x)\n    @dprint(x + y)\n}"}
