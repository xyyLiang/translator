{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What is a while-let expression in Cangjie?\nANSWER:The while-let expression in Cangjie is a loop construct that combines pattern matching with a while loop. It evaluates the expression on the right-hand side of the <- operator and matches it against the pattern on the left-hand side. If the pattern matches, the loop body is executed, and the process repeats. If the pattern does not match, the loop terminates, and execution continues with the code following the while-let expression.import std.random.*\n// This function simulates the process of receiving data in a communication, and obtaining the data may fail.\nfunc recv(): Option<UInt8> {\n    let number = Random().nextUInt8()\n    if (number < 128) {\n        return Some(number)\n    }\n    return None\n}\n\nmain() {\n    // Simulate a loop to receive communication data. If the process fails, terminate the loop.\n    while (let Some(data) <- recv()) {\n        println(data)\n    }\n    println(\"receive failed\")\n}\n//output：\n//73\n//94\n//receive failed"}
