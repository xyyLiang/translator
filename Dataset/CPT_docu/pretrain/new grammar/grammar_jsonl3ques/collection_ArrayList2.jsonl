{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to use ArrayList in Cangjie?\nANSWER:To use the ArrayList type in Cangjie, you need to import the collection package. ArrayList<T> is used to represent an ArrayList type, where T is the element type of the ArrayList and can be any type. ArrayList has excellent capacity for resizing and is suitable for scenarios that require frequent addition and deletion of elements.\nIn contrast to Array, ArrayList can modify elements in place, as well as add and remove elements in place.import collection.ArrayList\nfun main() {\n    var list = ArrayList<Int64>()\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,What are the properties of ArrayList in Cangjie?\nANSWER:ArrayList is mutable, allowing all references to the same instance to share and modify the same elements.\nArrayList supports element modification, addition, and deletion in place, unlike Array.\nArrayList instances with different element types are considered different types and cannot be assigned to each other.\nThe variability of ArrayList is a very useful feature that allows all references to the same ArrayList instance to share the same element and modify them uniformly.\n\nError_case:\nvar list1 = ArrayList<Int64>()\nvar list2 = ArrayList<String>()\nlist1 = list2 // This will cause a compile-time error"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to access the ArrayList member in Cangjie?\nANSWER:When you need access to all the elements of an ArrayList, you can use a for-in loop to iterate through all the elements of the ArrayList.\nWhen you need to know the number of elements in an ArrayList, you can use the size attribute to get the corresponding information.\nWhen you want to access an element in a single specified location, you can use the subscript syntax to access it (the subscript type must be Int64). The first element of a non-empty ArrayList always starts at position 0. You can access any element of the ArrayList from 0 up to the last position (size - 1 of the ArrayList). Using a negative number or an index greater than or equal to size triggers a runtime exception.\nArrayList also supports the syntax for using Range in subscripts,as detailed in the Array section.//for-in \nimport std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let list = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\n    for (i in list) {\n        println(\"The element is ${i}\")\n    }\n}\n\n//know the number of elements \nimport std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let list = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\n    if (list.size == 0) {\n        println(\"This is an empty arraylist\")\n    } else {\n        println(\"The size of arraylist is ${list.size}\")\n    }\n}\n\n//access an element in a single specified location\nimport std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let list = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\n    let a = list[0] // a == 0\n    let b = list[1] // b == 1\n    let c = list[-1] // Runtime exceptions\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to modify elements in an ArrayList in Cangjie?\nANSWER:You can modify elements in an ArrayList using subscript syntax. Since ArrayList is a reference type, modifications to elements affect all references to the same instance.let list = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\nlist[0] = 3\n\nlet list1 = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2])\nlet list2 = list1\nlist2[0] = 3\n// list1 contains elements 3, 1, 2\n// list2 contains elements 3, 1, 2"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to add elements to an ArrayList in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Use the append function to add a single element to the end of the ArrayList.\nUse the appendAll function to add multiple elements from another collection (e.g., Array) to the end of the ArrayList.\nYou can use the insert and insertAll functions to insert a specified single element or a Collection value of the same element type into the location of the specified index. The elements at the index and the elements behind them are moved back to make space.import std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let list = ArrayList<Int64>()\n    list.append(0) // list contains element 0\n    list.append(1) // list contains elements 0, 1\n    let li = [2, 3]\n    list.appendAll(li) // list contains elements 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n    let list2 = ArrayList<Int64>([0, 1, 2]) // list2 contains elements 0, 1, 2\n    list2.insert(1, 4) // list2 contains elements 0, 4, 1, 2\n}"}
{"text": "QUESTION:In Cangjie code language,How to remove elements from an ArrayList in Cangjie?\nANSWER:Use the remove function to delete an element from the ArrayList by specifying its index. Subsequent elements will shift to the left to fill the space.let list = ArrayList<String>([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]) // list contains the elements \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"\nlist.remove(1) // Delete the element at subscript 1, now the list contains elements \"a\", \"c\", \"d\"\nID: collection_arraylist_resizing\nTITLE: Increase the size of the ArrayList in Cangjie\nTAGS: collection, arraylist, resizing, increase\nLANGUAGE: Cangjie\nQUESTION: How to increase the size of the ArrayList in Cangjie?\nDESCRIPTION:\nEach ArrayList requires a specific amount of memory to hold its contents. When an element is added to an ArrayList and that ArrayList starts to exceed its reserved capacity, the ArrayList allocates a larger memory area and copies all of its elements to the new memory. This growth strategy means that adding operations that trigger a reallocation of memory has a performance cost, but they occur less frequently as the reserved memory of the ArrayList grows.\nIf you know how many elements you need to add, you can improve performance by preparing enough memory before adding to avoid re-allocation.\nEXAMPLES:\nimport std.collection.*\nmain() {\n    let list = ArrayList<Int64>(100) // Allocate space at once\n    for (i in 0..100) {\n        list.append(i) // Does not trigger reallocation of space\n    }\n    list.reserve(100) // Prepare more space\n    for (i in 0..100) {\n        list.append(i) // Does not trigger reallocation of space\n    }\n}"}
