{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_api_overview_cangjie_libs_overview': 'When using Cangjie Code API, The Cangjie programming language includes the std module (standard library module) and several commonly used extension modules. Each module contains several packages that provide specific and rich functionalities related to the module.\nThe standard library provides the most common APIs, including input/output functions, basic data structures and algorithms, date and time representations, etc. Extension libraries focus on specific domains, such as the compress module for compression and decompression capabilities, the crypto module for encryption and decryption capabilities, and the net module for efficient network protocol parsing and communication capabilities.\nThe standard library and officially provided extension libraries all comply with the Cangjie language programming specifications and meet official standards in functionality, performance, and security.'"}
{"text": "'Cangjie programming language_api_overview_cangjie_libs_usage': 'When using Cangjie Code API, In the Wukong programming language, a package is the smallest unit of compilation, and each package can output products such as AST files, static library files, dynamic library files, etc., individually. Packages can define sub-packages, thereby forming a tree-like structure. A package without a parent is called a root package, and the entire tree consisting of the root package and its sub-packages (including sub-packages of sub-packages) is called a module (module). The name of the module is the same as that of the root package, and it is the smallest unit published by third-party developers.\nThe import rules for packages are as follows:\nYou can import a top-level declaration or definition from a package, with the syntax:\nimport fullPackageName.itemName\n\nWhere fullPackageName is the full path package name, and itemName is the name of the declaration, for example:\nimport std.collection.ArrayList\n\nIf multiple itemName to be imported are part of the same fullPackageName, you can use:\nimport fullPackageName.{itemName[, itemName]*}\nFor example:import std.collection.{ArrayList, HashMap}\n\nYou can also import all top-level declarations or definitions in the `fullPackageName` package that are decorated with the `public` modifier, with the following syntax:\nimport fullPackageName.*\nFor example:import std.collection.*'"}
