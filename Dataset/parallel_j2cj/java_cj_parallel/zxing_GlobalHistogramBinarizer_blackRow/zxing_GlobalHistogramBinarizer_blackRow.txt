  /**
   * Converts one row of luminance data to 1 bit data. May actually do the conversion, or return
   * cached data. Callers should assume this method is expensive and call it as seldom as possible.
   * This method is intended for decoding 1D barcodes and may choose to apply sharpening.
   * For callers which only examine one row of pixels at a time, the same BitArray should be reused
   * and passed in with each call for performance. However it is legal to keep more than one row
   * at a time if needed.
   *
   * @param y The row to fetch, which must be in [0, bitmap height)
   * @param row An optional preallocated array. If null or too small, it will be ignored.
   *            If used, the Binarizer will call BitArray.clear(). Always use the returned object.
   * @return The array of bits for this row (true means black).
   * @throws NotFoundException if row can't be binarized
