   * Create a representation of GF(size) using the given primitive polynomial.
   *
   * @param primitive irreducible polynomial whose coefficients are represented by
   *  the bits of an int, where the least-significant bit represents the constant
   *  coefficient
   * @param size the size of the field
   * @param b the factor b in the generator polynomial can be 0- or 1-based
   *  (g(x) = (x+a^b)(x+a^(b+1))...(x+a^(b+2t-1))).
   *  In most cases it should be 1, but for QR code it is 0.
