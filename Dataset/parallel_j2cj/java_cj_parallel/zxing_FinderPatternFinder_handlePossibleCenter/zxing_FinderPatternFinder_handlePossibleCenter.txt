  /**
   * <p>This is called when a horizontal scan finds a possible alignment pattern. It will
   * cross check with a vertical scan, and if successful, will, ah, cross-cross-check
   * with another horizontal scan. This is needed primarily to locate the real horizontal
   * center of the pattern in cases of extreme skew.
   * And then we cross-cross-cross check with another diagonal scan.</p>
   *
   * <p>If that succeeds the finder pattern location is added to a list that tracks
   * the number of times each location has been nearly-matched as a finder pattern.
   * Each additional find is more evidence that the location is in fact a finder
   * pattern center
   *
   * @param stateCount reading state module counts from horizontal scan
   * @param i row where finder pattern may be found
   * @param j end of possible finder pattern in row
   * @return true if a finder pattern candidate was found this time
