    /*
     * Maps the given name of a compressed file to the name
     * that the file should have after uncompression.
     * Commonly used file type specific suffixes like ".tgz" or ".svgz"
     * are automatically detected and correctly mapped.
     * For example the name "package.tgz" is mapped to "package.tar".
     * And any file names with the generic ".gz" suffix
     * (or any other generic gzip suffix) is mapped to a name without that suffix.
     * If no format suffix is detected, then the file name is returned unmapped.
     *
     * @param fileName name of a file
     * @return name of the corresponding uncompressed file
