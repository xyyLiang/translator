     * Parses a simple token.
     * Simple tokens are tokens that are not surrounded by encapsulators. A simple token might contain escaped
     * delimiters (as \, or \;). The token is finished when one of the following conditions becomes true:
     * The end of line has been reached (EORECORD)</li>
     * The end of stream has been reached (EOF)</li>
     * An unescaped delimiter has been reached (TOKEN)</li>
     *
     * @param  token     the current token
     * @param  ch        the current character
     * @return the filled token
