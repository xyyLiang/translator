     * <li>If the Repeat Count is <code>0</code>, then the instruction will
     * be interpreted as <code>MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW</code>.</li>

     * the instruction will be interpreted as <code>MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT</code>.
     * <b>WARNING:</b> using MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT 
     * with a trigger that has a non-null end-time may cause the trigger to 
     * never fire again if the end-time arrived during the misfire time span. 
     * </li>
     * <li>If the Repeat Count is <code>&gt; 0</code>, then the instruction
     * will be interpreted as <code>MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT</code>.
