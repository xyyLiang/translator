/**
 * Checks if there is another idle task with the same filename and potentially same file content.
 * This method is applicable only if the current task has a filename derived from the response.
 * If another idle task with the same filename is found and meets certain conditions (e.g., total offset, ETag, file length),
 * its information is reused to potentially accelerate the download process.
 *
 * @param task           The DownloadTask for which to inspect another idle task.
 * @param info           The BreakpointInfo containing information about the current download task.
 * @param instanceLength The length of the file being downloaded.
 * @return {@code true} if another idle task with the same filename is found and its information is reused; {@code false} otherwise.
