  /**
   * We're going to examine rows from the middle outward, searching alternately above and below the
   * middle, and farther out each time. rowStep is the number of rows between each successive
   * attempt above and below the middle. So we'd scan row middle, then middle - rowStep, then
   * middle + rowStep, then middle - (2 * rowStep), etc.
   * rowStep is bigger as the image is taller, but is always at least 1. We've somewhat arbitrarily
   * decided that moving up and down by about 1/16 of the image is pretty good; we try more of the
   * image if "trying harder".
   *
   * @param image The image to decode
   * @param hints Any hints that were requested
   * @return The contents of the decoded barcode
   * @throws NotFoundException Any spontaneous errors which occur
