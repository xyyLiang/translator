     * It should be extremely rare for this method to throw an exception -
     * basically only the the case where there is no way at all to instantiate
     * and prepare the Job for execution.  When the exception is thrown, the
     * Scheduler will move all triggers associated with the Job into the
     * <code>Trigger.STATE_ERROR</code> state, which will require human
     * intervention (e.g. an application restart after fixing whatever 
     * configuration problem led to the issue wih instantiating the Job.

     * @param bundle
     *            The TriggerFiredBundle from which the <code>JobDetail</code>
     *            and other info relating to the trigger firing can be obtained.
     * @param scheduler a handle to the scheduler that is about to execute the job.
     * @throws SchedulerException if there is a problem instantiating the Job.
     * @return the newly instantiated Job
