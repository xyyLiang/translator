    /**
     * For sparse tar entries, there are many "holes"(consisting of all 0) in the file. Only the non-zero data is stored in tar files, and they are stored
     * separately. The structure of non-zero data is introduced by the sparse headers using the offset, where a block of non-zero data starts, and numbytes, the
     * length of the non-zero data block. When reading sparse entries, the actual data is read out with "holes" and non-zero data combined together according to
     * the sparse headers.
     *
     * @param buf       The buffer into which to place bytes read.
     * @param offset    The offset at which to place bytes read.
     * @param numToRead The number of bytes to read.
     * @return The number of bytes read, or -1 at EOF.
     * @throws IOException on error
