    /**
     * For PAX Format 0.0, the sparse headers(GNU.sparse.offset and GNU.sparse.numbytes) may appear multi times, and they look like:
     *
     * GNU.sparse.size=size GNU.sparse.numblocks=numblocks repeat numblocks times GNU.sparse.offset=offset GNU.sparse.numbytes=numbytes end repeat
     *
     *
     * For PAX Format 0.1, the sparse headers are stored in a single variable : GNU.sparse.map
     *
     * GNU.sparse.map Map of non-null data chunks. It is a string consisting of comma-separated values "offset,size[,offset-1,size-1...]"
     *
     *
     * For PAX Format 1.X: The sparse map itself is stored in the file data block, preceding the actual file data. It consists of a series of decimal numbers
     * delimited by newlines. The map is padded with nulls to the nearest block boundary. The first number gives the number of entries in the map. Following are
     * map entries, each one consisting of two numbers giving the offset and size of the data block it describes.
     *
     * @throws IOException
