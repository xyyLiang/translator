  /**
   * This method deals with the fact, that the decoding process doesn't always yield a single most likely value. The
   * current error correction implementation doesn't deal with erasures very well, so it's better to provide a value
   * for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure. The problem is that we don't know which of
   * the ambiguous values to choose. We try decode using the first value, and if that fails, we use another of the
   * ambiguous values and try to decode again. This usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes,
   * so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this.
   *
   * @param erasureArray contains the indexes of erasures
   * @param ambiguousIndexes array with the indexes that have more than one most likely value
   * @param ambiguousIndexValues two dimensional array that contains the ambiguous values. The first dimension must
   * be the same length as the ambiguousIndexes array
