    /**
     * Maps the given name of a bzip2-compressed file to the name that the file should have after uncompression. Commonly used file type specific suffixes like
     * ".tbz" or ".tbz2" are automatically detected and correctly mapped. For example the name "package.tbz2" is mapped to "package.tar". And any file names
     * with the generic ".bz2" suffix (or any other generic bzip2 suffix) is mapped to a name without that suffix. If no bzip2 suffix is detected, then the file
     * name is returned unmapped.
     *
     * @param fileName name of a file
     * @return name of the corresponding uncompressed file
