     * <p>
     * Returns a date that is rounded to the next even multiple of the given
     * minute.

     * 
     * <p>
     * For example an input date with a time of 08:13:54, and an input
     * minute-base of 5 would result in a date with the time of 08:15:00. The
     * same input date with an input minute-base of 10 would result in a date
     * with the time of 08:20:00. But a date with the time 08:53:31 and an
     * input minute-base of 45 would result in 09:00:00, because the even-hour
     * is the next 'base' for 45-minute intervals.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param date
     *          the Date to round, if <code>null</code> the current time will
     *          be used
     * @param minuteBase
     *          the base-minute to set the time on
     * @return the new rounded date
