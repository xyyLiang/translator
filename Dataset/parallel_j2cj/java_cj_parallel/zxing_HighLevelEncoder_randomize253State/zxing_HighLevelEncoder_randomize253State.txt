/**
 * Randomizes the state using a pseudo-random algorithm based on the provided codeword position.
 * This method generates a random value between 1 and 253, inclusive, and adds it to the PAD value.
 * If the result exceeds 254, it wraps around to the range [1, 254].
 *
 * @param codewordPosition The position of the codeword in the encoding.
 * @return The randomized state value.
