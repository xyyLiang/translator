   * <p>This method traces a line from a point in the image, in the direction towards another point.
   * It begins in a black region, and keeps going until it finds white, then black, then white again.
   * It reports the distance from the start to this point.</p>
   *
   * <p>This is used when figuring out how wide a finder pattern is, when the finder pattern
   * may be skewed or rotated.</p>
