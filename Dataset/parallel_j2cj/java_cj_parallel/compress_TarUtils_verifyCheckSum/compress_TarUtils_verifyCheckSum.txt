    /*
     * The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values
     * of the header block with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii
     * spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with
     * leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various
     * implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,
     * ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In
     * addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.
     * Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it
     * as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included
     * checksum.
     * The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort
     * heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth. The checksum
     * verification logic may well evolve over time as more special cases
     * are encountered.
     *
     * @param header tar header
     * @return whether the checksum is reasonably good
