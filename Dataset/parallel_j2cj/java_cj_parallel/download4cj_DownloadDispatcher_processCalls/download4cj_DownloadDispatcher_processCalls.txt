/**
 * Processes the queued download calls for execution.
 * This method checks if it is allowed to proceed with processing calls, if the maximum parallel running count
 * has been reached, and if there are any queued download calls to process. If conditions are met, it iterates
 * through the queued download calls, removes them from the queue, checks for file conflicts, and executes
 * them asynchronously. It stops processing if the maximum parallel running count is reached or if there are
 * no more queued calls.
