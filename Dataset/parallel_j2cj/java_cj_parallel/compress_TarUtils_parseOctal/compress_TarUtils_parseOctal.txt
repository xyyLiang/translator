     * Parse an octal string from a buffer.
     *
     * <p>Leading spaces are ignored.
     * The buffer must contain a trailing space or NUL,
     * and may contain an additional trailing space or NUL.</p>
     *
     * <p>The input buffer is allowed to contain all NULs,
     * in which case the method returns 0L
     * (this allows for missing fields).</p>
     *
     * <p>To work-around some tar implementations that insert a
     * leading NUL this method returns 0 if it detects a leading NUL
     * since Commons Compress 1.4.</p>
     *
     * @param buffer The buffer from which to parse.
     * @param offset The offset into the buffer from which to parse.
     * @param length The maximum number of bytes to parse - must be at least 2 bytes.
     * @return The long value of the octal string.
