     * Ensures that the given run of characters is a valid JSON number.  This is
     * less aggressive than {@link #canonicalizeNumber} since it can be called
     * on inputs that are valid JSON so is on the fast path.
     *
     * JS numbers differ from JSON numbers in several ways:<ul>
     * <li>They can have '+' as a sign prefix:  +1
     * <li>They allow a 0x... hexadecimal form: 0xA4
     * <li>They allow a 0... octal form:        012
     * <li>The integer part can be empty:       .5
     * <li>The fraction part can be empty:      1.
     * </ul>
