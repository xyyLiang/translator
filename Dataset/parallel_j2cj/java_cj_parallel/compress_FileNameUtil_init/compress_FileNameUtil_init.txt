    /**
     * sets up the utility with a map of known compressed to uncompressed suffix mappings and the default extension of the format.
     *
     * @param uncompressSuffix Map from common file name suffixes of compressed files to the corresponding suffixes of uncompressed files. For example: from
     *                         ".tgz" to ".tar". This map also contains format-specific suffixes like ".gz" and "-z". These suffixes are mapped to the empty
     *                         string, as they should simply be removed from the file name when the file is uncompressed.
     *
     * @param defaultExtension the format's default extension like ".gz"
