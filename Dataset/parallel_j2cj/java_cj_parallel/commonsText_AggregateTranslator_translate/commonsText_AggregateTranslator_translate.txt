     * The first translator to consume code points from the input is the 'winner'.
     * Execution stops with the number of consumed code points being returned.
     * Translate a set of code points, represented by an int index into a CharSequence,
     * into another set of code points. The number of code points consumed must be returned,
     * and the only IOExceptions thrown must be from interacting with the Writer so that
     * the top level API may reliably ignore StringWriter IOExceptions.

     * @param index int representing the current point of translation
     * @param writer Writer to translate the text to
     * @return int count of code points consumed
     * @throws IOException if and only if the Writer produces an IOException
